This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various tasks related to interacting with the OpenAI API. The scripts include:

- **task_1.py**: Sends a request to the ChatGPT API and prints the response.
- **task_2.py**: Handles errors (like rate limit and network errors) when making API calls.
- **task_3.py**: Displays responses interactively using streaming.
- **task_4.py**: A Flask endpoint that forwards a request to OpenAI, combining error handling and streaming responses.
